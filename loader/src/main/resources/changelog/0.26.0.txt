Features:

- [#418] Publish loader dependencies as a separate module (lukebemish)
    - Now all of loaders direct dependencies are published in "org.quiltmc:quilt-loader-dependencies"
    - This doesn't affect minecraft development environments, and is instead useful when depending on loader without using loom.
- Add a system property ("loader.disable_url_stream_factory") to disable DelegatingUrlStreamHandlerFactory.
- Updated Quilt Config to 1.3.1

Bug Fixes:

- [#425] Fix version predicates like "2.x" not matching versions with a prerelease component, like "2.0.0-beta.1"

Changes from updating Fabric Loader from 0.15.7 to 0.15.10

- Updated Mixin to 0.13.3
- Added version parsing support for 24w14potato
