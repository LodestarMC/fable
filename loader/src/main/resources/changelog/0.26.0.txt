Features:

- [#418] Publish loader dependencies as a separate module (lukebemish)
    - Now all of loaders direct dependencies are published in "org.quiltmc:quilt-loader-dependencies"
    - This doesn't affect minecraft development environments, and is instead useful when depending on loader without using loom.
- Add a system property ("loader.disable_url_stream_factory") to disable DelegatingUrlStreamHandlerFactory.

Bug Fixes:

- [#425] Fix version predicates like "2.x" not matching versions with a prerelease component, like "2.0.0-beta.1"
